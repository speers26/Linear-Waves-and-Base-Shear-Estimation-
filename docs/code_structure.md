# Wave Spectrum

## TODO
 - rationalise, angular versus time frequency

# Method
    * Spreading Function
        - gaussian, cosine2s
    * Directional Spectra
    * ACF
    * Moments

## Subtypes
    * JONSWAP
    * JONSWAP (Jake version)

# kinematics

## INPUTS
    - locations
    * times
    * sea state/spectra

## Methods
    u  computed at times   - locations to add
    du computed at times   - locations to add

## Subtypes
