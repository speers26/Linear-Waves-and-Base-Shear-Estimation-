# Linear Waves and Base Shear Estimation-

Repository for wavesim package. Allows for the simulation of short term wave variability for given sea-state conditions, and the estimation of resulting maximum base shear response distributions on stick structures.

Includes code used for response distribution and CDE estimation in https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16775
