# Linear Waves and Base Shear Estimation

Repository for wavesim package. Allows for the simulation of short term wave variability for given sea-state conditions, and the estimation of resulting maximum base shear response distributions on stick structures.

Includes code used for response distribution and CDE estimation in https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16775

Some functionality relies on outputs from https://github.com/speers26/IFORM-contour-and-CDE-estimation-in-R

To produced results seen in https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16775, run the scripts in folder 2024Paper_scripts
