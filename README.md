# Wave sim and force calculation

Repository for wavesim and force calculation package. Allows for the simulation of short term wave variability for given sea-state conditions, and the estimation of resulting maximum response force distributions.

Includes code used for response distribution and CDE estimation in https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16775
